# MSP - Manifesto Summarisation Project

This is the source code for the website which provides users with political data and summarised manifestos.

IDEAS FOR FUTURE:
- current polls on front page
- possibly news segments/titles alongside them
- being able to see where the summarisation has taken information in the main manifesto
- highlighting/annotating manifestos
- other stats on the front page
